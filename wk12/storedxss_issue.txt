Stored XSS Issue:

The PHP page 'storexss.php' reads from a file and directly outputs it without sanitizing the content. If the file contains JavaScript, it gets executed in the browser.

This is dangerous because:
- It allows attackers to persist malicious code.
- Anyone who loads the page becomes a victim.
- It can be used for phishing, stealing session cookies, or redirecting users to unsafe pages.
