CSRF Test Observations:

1) When using csfr_form.php (legit form), the session token and form token match. The login succeeds.

2) When using csfr.html (attacker page), the login fails because it does not have the valid session token.

This shows that CSRF mitigation using session tokens successfully blocks unauthorized requests
