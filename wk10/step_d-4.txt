What I see on the browser:
The page displays a list of files and folders from a parent directory of /var/www/html, possibly /var/www or even the root filesystem if you go high enough.

What sensitive information is given by this page:
It exposes parts of the serverâ€™s filesystem structure. An attacker can explore directories outside the web root, which could include configuration files, logs, or even user data.
