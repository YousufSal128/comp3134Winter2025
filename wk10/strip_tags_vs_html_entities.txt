strip_tags vs htmlentities:

- strip_tags():
  This function removes all HTML and PHP tags from the input.
  It prevents any HTML or script tags from being interpreted or shown.
  However, it also removes useful formatting (e.g., <b>bold</b> becomes just "bold").

- htmlentities():
  This function converts HTML characters into safe equivalents.
  For example, < becomes &lt; and > becomes &gt;.
  This preserves the original input for display but prevents browser execution.

In summary:
- strip_tags removes all tags entirely
- htmlentities keeps the input visible but harmless
