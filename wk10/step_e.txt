How I mitigated the issues:

1. To prevent users from accessing folders above the web root, I used `basename()` to strip directory traversal attempts like `../`.
2. To ensure the user isn't pointing to a non-existent or malicious path, I used `file_exists()` and `is_dir()` to validate the input.
Bonus:
I also blocked any input containing a dot (`.`) to prevent users from passing filenames or dot-based traversal. This ensures only valid folder names within the web root can be accessed.
