What I see on the browser:
The page displays a PHP warning or error saying that the 'hello' directory does not exist. It shows a warning like "scandir(hello): failed to open dir: No such file or directory".

What sensitive information is given by this page:
The PHP warning reveals:
- The full absolute path of the web root directory on the server (e.g., /var/www/html/)
- The file structure or internal directory names if the path exists
- It exposes the server is using PHP and Apache
This can help an attacker perform a directory traversal or recon for further exploitation.
